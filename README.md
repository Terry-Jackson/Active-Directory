<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Setup a VM Domain Controller (Windows Server2022) as well a Client VM (Windows 10) 
- Remote Desktop into Domain Controller from Client 1 with (perpetual Ping)
- Install Active Directory Domain Services onto DC
- Setup a New Forest
- Create Organizational Units in (ADUC)
- Run Script in Powershell_ise as administrator to populate user accounts
<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

Create a resource group. Once you have the resource group created. The next step will be to create a (VM) for your Domain Controller using (Windows Server 2022)

Click on Virtual Machines and Create Azure Virtual Machine for Domain Controller.

After (DC) is setup we will need to go into the NIC and change the IP address settings to Static.

Next we will Create another (VM) setting up Client-1 with (Windows 10)

![Open Remote Desktop and Paste IP Address ](https://github.com/Terry-Jackson/Active-Directory/assets/155121596/37a0eb72-a5cf-4f1a-8187-70a53c29c216)

Paste the public IP address of Client-1 in order to remote into computer.
<br>
<br>
<br>

![Add Credentials for Client 1 in order to remote into the system](https://github.com/Terry-Jackson/Active-Directory/assets/155121596/b3c93987-5eed-49b0-93d0-a6ecb683d92b)

Add credentials for Client-1 in order to remote into (VM)
<br>
<br>
<br>

![Click yes in order to Remote Desktop into System](https://github.com/Terry-Jackson/Active-Directory/assets/155121596/c3fa1d68-0ee6-4542-9868-77cd0adf8b14)

Click yes in order to proceed in remoting into system.
<br>

![Once I enable ICMPv4 On DC-1 the Request Timed out will Change ](https://github.com/Terry-Jackson/Active-Directory/assets/155121596/32d06f3e-34e5-4b04-a685-a1475e0b5c64)

Logged into Client-1 and ping DC-1â€™s private IP address with ping -t <ip address> (perpetual ping) Once we go into the firewall settings of DC-1 and enable the ICMPv4 protocol the request timeout will change.
<br>
<br>
<br>

![Click on Inbound Rules 1](https://github.com/Terry-Jackson/Active-Directory/assets/155121596/3e3e5670-e1de-4d94-b127-924c6f067599)

Find the Windows firewall settings and click on Inbound Rules. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

![Enable this Rule Private 2](https://github.com/Terry-Jackson/Active-Directory/assets/155121596/cab41777-ae9c-4ccb-8305-75e33f0c3e9d)

Enable this Rule. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

![Enable this Rule Domain 3](https://github.com/Terry-Jackson/Active-Directory/assets/155121596/9cf3bbca-e6ce-42e3-a70c-eb0dd46c83c4)

Enable this Rule as well for the ICMPv4 Protocol.
<br>
<br>
<br>

![No longer timing out](https://github.com/Terry-Jackson/Active-Directory/assets/155121596/9c88415d-4cfc-465d-9e8c-fc6449cf6017)

Once I enable ICMPv4 On DC-1 the Request Timed out Changed.
